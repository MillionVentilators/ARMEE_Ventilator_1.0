## INTRO

This repository contains plans for a device which controls air (or gas) flow so that its output alternates between two pressure levels.  The pressures, flow rates and cycle times are similar to the typical output of a mechanical ventilator.  *It has no moving parts*, and could be produced very rapidly, at low cost and in very large numbers if needed.

The original design dates to the early 1960s:
* J.W. Joyce, Jr. ["TM 68-30 The Army Emergency Respirator"](./research/1968_Army_Emergency_Respirator.pdf). Harry Diamond Labs, US Army Materiel Command, 1968

We are working to modify it to make the output better match modern requirements.

This is an open source hardware project: all work is licensed under the CERN Open Hardware Licence v2 (strongly reciprocal).


## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

Get the necessary [Equipment](./documentation/Equipment.md): a source of compressed air, pressure and flow gauges and a test lung.

Build one of the [Stable Models](./stable/), following the [Build Instructions](./documentation/Build_Instructions.md): the recommended method is to use a CNC mill to make this out of plastic, but feel free to experiment.

The [Monostable](./experimental/Monostable) design is currently the most promising model, with results close to target parameters and very stable switching.  Check it out.

Run some tests following the [Test Instructions](./documentation/Test_Instructions.md).

Try to modify the design so as to address some of the [Open Issues](./documentation/Open_Issues.md).
